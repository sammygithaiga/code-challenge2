#### CODE CHALLENGE (challenge-2)

### Date--2024/03/23

### By --Samuel Githaiga

## Description 
It is a webpage that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

### Installition Requirements
Git

## Installition instractions
clone the link from your git  account and push it after creating a new repository.


## Technologies used 
Javascript
GitHub
## How to go about it
>Create a function called calculateDemeritPoints with speed as the parameter.
>Then create a constat speed limit = 70 and another kmperDiameterpoint = 5 and another called  const pointsPerKmOverLimit = 1 .
>Use if to show that speed is less than the speed limit then console.log ok to show the speed is okay then return 0.
>Create const kmOverLimit = speed - speedLimit and another const demeritPoints = Math.floor(kmOverLimit / kmPerDemeritPoint) then use the if and the else syntax.
